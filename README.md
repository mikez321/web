# A personal Website!

This is my second iteration of my personal website.  My previous one had a fun little spinning CSS animation.  This one is designed first to be responsive using an @media rule to stack my divs for smaller devices.  Before designing anything, I laid out all my containers and made sure they were responsive.  I then went without any images, and used bold, large fonts as images in themselves.  I rather like it!  [See it in the wild.](https://mikez321.github.io)
