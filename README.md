# A personal Website!

This is my second iteration of my personal website.  My previous one had a fun little spinning CSS animation.  This one is designed first to be responsive using an @media rule to stack my divs for smaller devices.  Before designing anything, I laid out all my containers and made sure they were responsive.  I then went without any images, and used bold, large fonts as images in themselves.  I rather like it!  [See it in the wild.](https://mikez321.github.io)

__Update!__

I finally got over my fear and added some Javascript!  Giving credit where credit is due, I followed [this tutoral](https://stef.ninja/javascript30-day-16/) which is based off [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaz9gLI-Xac) by Wes Bos.  While I couldn't have figured all this out without help, I did get to learn about eventListeners, got more comfortable with how to write JS, understand what my code is doing, and also had to troubleshoot why I kept getting errors (javascript embed tag was before page loaded in my middleman app).
